The SSO is implemented on this code using a union. There is a union in MyString called sso, which has two members: _heap and _stack. The _heap member is a pointer to the char array allocated to the heap, while the _stack member is a char array allocated to the stack.
If a MyString object is created, its constructor checks to see if the string data fits within the defined SSO limit.
The other functions are the same as the class we implemented in lectures.
